Simple project ideas you can build with [OutSystems](https://outsyste.ms/community) to strengthen your skills.

## 1) Google Drive Direct Link Generator
[This tool](https://sites.google.com/site/gdocs2direct/home) allows user to generate a direct download link to files they have stored in Google Drive. A direct link will immediately start downloading the file, rather than opening a preview of the file in Google Drive. You can try building this with OutSystems.
